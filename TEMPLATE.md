I am squerez, I have joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.
When I started, I did not know even how to program an "hello world", now I still can't program much more.

However, some progress has been made.
Since then I have:

- pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits;
- opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues;
- submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests;
- received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects;
- and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

Most used languages across my projects:

{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_START }}

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am *squerez* and I have joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.

When I started, I did not know even how to program an "hello world", now I still can't program much more **ba dum tss**.

However, since then, some progress has been made:

- pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits;
- opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues;
- submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests;
- received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects;
- and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

Most used languages across my projects:

{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_START }}
![{{LANGUAGE_NAME}}](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label=%E2%A0%80&color=555&labelColor={{LANGUAGE_COLOR:uri}}&message={{LANGUAGE_NAME:uri}}%EF%B8%B1{{LANGUAGE_PERCENT:uri}}%25)
{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_END }}

I really like tinkering with technology and am currently on my way to learn the following technologies:

- **Rust**;
- **Go**;
- **Kubernetes**;
- **Spinnaker**;
- **Tekton**;
- **ArgoCD**;
- **Flux**;
- **Keptn**;
- **Ansible**;

I am on my way to become more active on personal projects, hopefully one day you can see my commit snake going around like crazy.
For now, just look at her go:

Isn't she lovely? 

Alright, this is the end of this README, bye!!

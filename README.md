### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!\
I'm *squerez*, just a regular tech enthusiast diving into this area for about **4** years now.

#### About me

I've always been captivated by tech and programming. \
When I first joined GitHub, just building a simple Python script to print messages in text boxes was quite
the challenge for me. Fast-forward to this day, I've made some progress, but hey, there's always more to explore and learn.

#### My contributions

So far, I've dipped my toes into several projects, mainly personal, hitting these milestones:

- I've committed **136** times to a bunch of different repos;
- Opened **3** issues and pushed **40** pull requests;
- My personal "pet" projects have scored around **4** stars, spread across **16** repositories;
- And contributed in **5** public repositories.

#### Languages I use

My playground involves various languages, but these are my go-tos:

#### Tech I'm learning 

I'm on a quest to level up my skills in:

- **Rust**;
- **Go**;
- **Ansible**;
- **Flux**.

When I'm not here, you might find me wandering in a forest of repositories, where I've gotten so lost, I've set up campsites in unfinished projects, in each a sign saying, `Under Construction Forever`!

You know, just your typical getaway from the world of 'done'.

Anyways, if you're still curious, check out my commit snake animation right here in my profile.\
It's a cool visual of my coding journey, constantly changing with each contribution.

#### My creative collection

Behold, my digital creations:

- [maestro](https://github.com/squerez/maestro) - a Python-based data engineering metadata-driven framework. Currently in a testing phase, evolving as I learn more in the DE field.; 
- [shamir](https://github.com/squerez/shamir) - a simple OTP API designed for team use, born from my curious mind exploring API design concepts.; 
- [rustsnake](https://github.com/squerez/rustnake) - a customizable snake game crafted in Rust, wWhere I've been playing with both the language and game development.; 
- [init.lua](https://github.com/squerez/init.lua) - my tangled web of Neovim configurations, ever-evolving to suit my whims as a lazy dev.

Feel free to take a look and see what I've been doing.

Thanks for swinging by and checking out my stuff.\

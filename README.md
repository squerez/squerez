### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm *squerez*, and I've been part of the GitHub community for the past **4** years.

#### Introduction 

I have always been fascinated by the world of programming and technology.\
When I first joined GitHub, I didn't even know how to program a simple "hello world" application.\
Fast forward to today, I've made progress, although there's still much more to learn and explore.

#### Contributions

Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to contribute to various projects.\
Here are some personal stats:

- Committed **126** times to a range of exciting projects;
- Opened **3** issues and submitted **40** pull requests, actively participating in **5** public repositories;
- My personal projects have earned recognition with **4** stars across **16** repositories.

#### Technologies I'm learning 

I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skillset by learning the following technologies:

- **Rust** - Exploring systems programming with a focus on safety and performance.
- **Go** - Embracing simplicity and concurrency in building scalable applications.
- **Ansible** - Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.
- **Flux** - Automating the deployment and lifecycle of Kubernetes resources.

I'm excited about the endless possibilities these technologies offer and how they can shape the future of software development.\
I'm constantly working on personal projects, and you can witness my commit snake animation evolving and growing with each contribution:

#### Personal portfolio

In the next list, you can find some of the projects I am passionate about that I've actively contributing to:

- [maestro](https://github.com/squerez/maestro) - my take on a python-based data engineering metadata driven framework that is untested on the real world (yet); 
- [shamir](https://github.com/squerez/shamir) - a simple one-time-password API to use among teams, created to learn about API designs; 
- [rustsnake](https://github.com/squerez/rustnake) - customizable snake game implemented in Rust, created to learn the language and explore game programming; 
- [init.lua](https://github.com/squerez/init.lua) - my configuration files for the neovim editor;
